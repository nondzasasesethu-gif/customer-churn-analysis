## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Overall churn rate is 27%** — meaning 1 in 4 customers leaves the platform
2. **Month-to-month contracts have 42% churn** vs only 3% for two-year contracts
3. **Fiber optic customers churn at 42%** — the highest of any internet service type
4. **Electronic check payments** are associated with the highest churn rate
5. **New customers are most at risk** — churn drops significantly after the first 12 months
6. **Senior citizens churn more** (36%) compared to non-senior customers
7. **Gender has no significant impact** on churn — nearly equal between male and female

## ✅ Recommendations

1. **Incentivize long-term contracts** — offer discounts to move month-to-month customers to annual or two-year plans
2. **Investigate Fiber optic service quality** — high churn suggests dissatisfaction with service or pricing
3. **Encourage automatic payment methods** — customers on electronic check have higher churn; nudge them toward auto-pay
4. **Early retention program** — target customers in their first 12 months with loyalty rewards or check-in calls
5. **Senior citizen support** — offer dedicated support or simplified plans for senior customers
